# Slide Architecture & Development Plan: From Data to Thesis (R4NTR)

This document establishes the pedagogical design, slide anatomy, depth targets, and chapter-by-chapter blueprint for the lecture slide decks of **From Data to Thesis: Research Data Analysis with R**.

It is directly modeled on the depth, cadence, and architectural standards of the companion engineering book (`new-lectures`), adapting its proven slide engineering practices to graduate research methodology, biostatistics, and data science with R.

## 1. Benchmark Analysis from the Reference Project (`new-lectures`)

An audit of the 18 slide decks in `new-lectures/content/slides/` reveals the following structural parameters:

| Metric | Reference Project Benchmark | R4NTR Slide Standard |
|---|---|---|
| **Average Slide Count** | 80–120 slides per chapter | 60–100 slides per chapter |
| **Pacing & Density** | 1 core concept per slide; no walls of text | 1 concept/finding per slide; 2–4 concise points |
| **Visual Artifacts** | ASCII dependency graphs, tables, code comparisons | ASCII flow diagrams, ggplot2 figures, syntax vs. output tables |
| **Concrete Case Study** | Consistent ecommerce platform problem | Consistent graduate study: Elaf’s 600 students, 4 semesters |
| **Output Format** | Standard Markdown (`---` slide delimiters) | Quarto RevealJS (`.qmd`) + Marp compatible Markdown |

## 2. The 7-Phase Pedagogical Slide Arc

Every chapter slide deck in R4NTR follows a strict, repeatable 7-phase sequence:

```text
Phase 1: The Thesis Hook (Elaf's dilemma & research question)
   │
Phase 2: What We Will Explain (Explicit roadmap & learning objectives)
   │
Phase 3: The Minimal Example (Handful of numbers: vectors/toy tibble)
   │
Phase 4: Theoretical & Methodological Mechanics (Intuition, assumptions, formulas)
   │
Phase 5: The Case-Study Analysis (Elaf's data: R code, tidy outputs, plots)
   │
Phase 6: In Your Field (Cross-disciplinary box: Health, Agriculture, Business)
   │
Phase 7: Reporting in a Thesis (APA/thesis wording, table design, checklist)
```

### Slide Anatomy Guidelines
1. **Title & Headline**: Every slide has a descriptive, assertive headline (e.g., `## Unequal Variances Distort the p-value`, not `## Levene's Test`).
2. **Text Constraint**: Maximum 3–4 bullet points or 35–45 words per slide.
3. **Paired Comparison Slides**: Use two sequential slides for `Problem` vs `Solution`, or side-by-side columns for `Old Way (SPSS/Base)` vs `Tidyverse Way`.
4. **Code Precision**: Keep R code blocks focused on 4–8 lines highlighting the exact verbs and pipes (`|>`).
